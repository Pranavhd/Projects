0,@USAirways Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923. Is there a delay?
1,"@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again."
2,@AmericanAir you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
3,"@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again."
4,"@AmericanAir 
Can you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks"
5,"@AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths"
6,@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
7,@AmericanAir I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land 😭
8,@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
9,@AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
10,@AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
11,"@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service"
12,"@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????"
13,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
14,"@americanair Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD"
15,@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
16,@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
17,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic ."
18,@AmericanAir thanks for reFlight Booking Problems me on a flight and then leaving my luggage in NYC. Unbelievable.
19,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs

24,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
25,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
26,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
27,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
28,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
29,@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
30,"@AmericanAir one of my luggage didn't made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told 😓😭"
31,@AmericanAir Still waiting on bags from flight 1613/2440 yesterday  First Class passenger not happy with your service.

106,@AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I'll reconsider my future flight options.
107,@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
108,@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
109,@AmericanAir Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK
110,@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
111,@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
112,"@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?"

117,@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
118,@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
119,@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
120,@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
121,"@AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning"
122,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
123,@AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from...
124,"@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in."
125,@AmericanAir Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn't work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.

436,@AmericanAir @USAirways - I'm pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it's your fault?
437,@AmericanAir I need assistance reFlight Booking Problems a flight from dfw to lit
438,@AmericanAir after several miss communications I was able to get to ORD but I am not home yet and not sure I will get there due to her error
439,"@AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA"
440,"@AmericanAir every time I try to call, it tells me to try again Late Flightr and just hangs up."
441,@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW
442,@AmericanAir I've never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers.
443,"@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it."
444,@AmericanAir thanks for being entirely unhelpful and wasting hours of my time today
445,@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
446,@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
447,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
448,@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
449,@AmericanAir I still can't get through to change my flight. This is really important plz help!
450,@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
451,@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
452,"@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!"
453,"@AmericanAir no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren't available"
454,@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
455,"@AmericanAir your a LIAR, no precipitation all day, 47 degrees, don't pacify, you look like a fool.......thats the problem, admit you suck"
456,@AmericanAir 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone.  You are un F-in believable.  worst ever
457,@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
458,".@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now"
459,@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
460,@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
461,@AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on.
462,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
463,"@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
464,@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
465,@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
466,@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
467,@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
468,@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
469,@AmericanAir Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can't be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday.
470,@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
471,@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
472,"@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis"
473,@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
474,@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
475,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
476,"@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day."
477,@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
478,"@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available."
479,@AmericanAir you keep returning my call and hanging up when I answer? Help reFlight Booking Problems a flight!
480,"@AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected"
481,@AmericanAir  terrible response! How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage
482,"@AmericanAir in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing."
483,@AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
484,@AmericanAir @EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply
485,@AmericanAir @usairways who is the next stop after customer service.
486,"@AmericanAir Trying desperately to rebook my moms flight. Waited 10 hours for callback, got disconnected and they didn’t call back. #help"
487,@AmericanAir you can tweet but not call! You're like a bad boyfriend!
488,@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
489,@AmericanAir Funny you should say that. I have been monitoring since January 1st. No change in availability. #fakeawards #LUVisbetter
490,@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
491,@AmericanAir customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
492,@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
493,@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?
494,"@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us."
495,@AmericanAir Trying  to Cancelled Flight fligt 2321 O'Hare to Dallas 12:17pm. High call volume no one answer. Online no confirmation. #thankU
496,@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel
497,@AmericanAir @united we'll have time and they aren't doing a damn thing. I'm the guy in the winter hat and frowny face
498,"@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra"
499,"@AmericanAir the customer service today is unsat, Flight cnx, not notified, called for 6 hours and the phone line does not even let me hold"
500,"@AmericanAir Howdy, having trouble getting rebooked after flight Cancelled Flightled. Can't get thru via phone and Web erroring out. Can you help?"
501,@AmericanAir Oh yea? That's it? C'mon buddy! Bring your special friend @united to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL
502,@AmericanAir thanks for the DM rescheduling. Unfortunately your operations process at LAX is chaos &amp; the reps refused to print the ticket
503,"@AmericanAir flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer..."
504,@AmericanAir =UNAmerican Airlines just lies and poor customer services...
505,"@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was ""no longer available"" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC"
506,"@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch"
507,@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
508,@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
509,@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
510,@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!
511,@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
512,@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
513,@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
514,@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week
515,@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
516,@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
517,@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
518,@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
519,@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.

521,"@AmericanAir Its the ABC's of PR, let your customers have the most info possible. Might want to go brush up on the basics..."

533,"@AmericanAir @Active_Aly thx. We have already been on the iberia website, and seat reservation is unavailable. Hopefully we can call them."
534,@AmericanAir this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?
535,@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
536,@AmericanAir.If I miss saying goodbye to my friend cause of your crappy service I swear you will never hear the end of it.#AmericanAirlines
537,@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether

543,"@AmericanAir husband &amp; I complain about same flight. He gets voucher, I get nothing. Because he flew biz!? Who do I email about this?"
544,@AmericanAir you're running 5+ hours behind replying to anyone via Twitter. this is beyond unacceptable. I'm running out of time!
545,@AmericanAir Have been trying to reach American Airlines since last evening to Cancelled Flight flights. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! What now???
546,@AmericanAir #worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
547,@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
548,@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
549,@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy
550,"@AmericanAir waited in the airport for two days to get home, not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to"

558,@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
559,@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
560,@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
561,@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
562,"@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations."
563,@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
564,"@AmericanAir our ft 1261 TUS/DFW (w/cx to LGA) tomorrow Cancelled Flighted,  4 hrs so far waiting for call back. What should we do? Need to get to nyc"
565,@AmericanAir I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
566,"@AmericanAir By ""answering as fast as they can"", you mean hanging up on every call?"
567,@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE 😤#ANGRY
568,@AmericanAir you can't change my flights and not have enough operators to handle calls.... #unacceptable #AmericanAirlines
569,@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
570,@AmericanAir it's been almost 3 days and it's still frozen. Thanks doll 😘😑
571,@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..
572,"@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail"
573,"@AmericanAir and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!"
574,@AmericanAir My ex-boyfriend picks up my calls more than you do! #Cancelled Flightedflight #nocustomerservice #americanairlines #FAIL
575,"@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove 
#whybeAAFF?"
576,@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
577,@americanair Any hints to get through to and stay connected with you to rearrange weather reLate Flightd Cancelled Flights? Hours in now w/nothing.
578,@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
579,@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
580,@AmericanAir pathetic service
581,@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
582,"@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!"
583,@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
584,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
585,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
586,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
587,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
588,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
589,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
590,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
591,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
592,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
593,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
594,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
595,"@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer..."
596,@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
597,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
598,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
599,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane😡
600,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
601,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
602,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
603,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
604,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
605,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
606,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
607,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
608,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
609,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
610,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
611,@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
612,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
613,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
614,@AmericanAir absolutely worse cust. Svc ever experienced in 25 yrs of flying.  Supvrs at iah extremely rude. #poorservice #travel
615,@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
616,@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
617,"@AmericanAir I've got a BA flight as your airport couldn't accommodate us. We were left without any info. No vouchers for food,nothing."
618,.@AmericanAir ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
619,@AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
620,"@AmericanAir @sa_craig no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers."
621,"@AmericanAir I've been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through?"
622,@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
623,@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
624,@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
625,@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
626,@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
627,@AmericanAir flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn't drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
628,@AmericanAir @dotnetnate Two hour wait for EXPs as I sit on a JFK PHX flight because US computers are down. Any shot at an LAX flight?
629,"@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly."
630,"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
631,"@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way."
632,@AmericanAir 250 I'm not sure if I'm rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:(
633,@AmericanAir that's if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer
634,@AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir
635,@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
636,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
637,"@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait ""over 2 hours"" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?"

657,"“@AmericanAir: @RussellsWriting Russ, please contact Reservations at 800-433-7300 for reFlight Booking Problems options.” Good luck with that!"
658,"@AmericanAir Changed flight from BNA to 2/20 ahead of weather. Slammed me with cost diff because ""no weather advisory.""Really!"
659,@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
660,"@AmericanAir first the pilot, then the catering..."
661,@AmericanAir I would like a refund for this flight. They delayed the flight 5 times. I feel like you're making fun of us.
662,@AmericanAir flight was 2488 out of EWR STOP AT DALLAS THEN TO LA. I need to be in la tonight!
663,@AmericanAir hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there's a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck!
664,@AmericanAir but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
665,@AmericanAir @cheerUPDATES So you're saying the call center is understaffed?
666,@AmericanAir I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
667,@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.

669,@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!!
670,"@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service"
671,"@AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn't your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything?"
672,"@AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there's only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal."
673,"@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work."
674,@AmericanAir @ActingOutMgmnt Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane. They Cancelled Flight the flight when they forget...
675,@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable
676,@AmericanAir @yvonneokaka When do I get my personal response and apology for your crew's having forgotten to load baggage onto my flight?
677,@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
678,@AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
679,@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
