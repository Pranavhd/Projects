21,@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
22,"@AmericanAir Great, then tell me how you will fix it? @Suntimes @WSJ @latimes @nytimes #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear"
23,@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?

25,"@AmericanAir lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again"

27,"@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service."

33,"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
34,"@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice"

39,"@AmericanAir Why is it ok that no-one can help me with the bag you lost on my honeymoon 3months ago, this is not responsible or professional"
40,@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
41,@AmericanAir they @cathaypacific @cathaypacificUS can't even tell me what country they are in ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
42,@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
43,"@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take ""18 hours"" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is ""the best we can"""
44,@AmericanAir haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke
45,"@AmericanAir  so far all I am getting is ""maybe your bag will come today. We don't know."" Website says ""status unknown""- can you help?"
46,"@AmericanAir I am, called Paris office this morning again, still waiting. It is in Miami but apparently tag was ""taken off"""

60,@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
61,@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
62,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
63,"@AmericanAir lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there."
64,"@AmericanAir you think I haven't tried that multiple times?? The ""status"" of my bag is that it should've been here YESTERDAY. So disgusted."

94,@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
95,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
96,@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
97,@AmericanAir the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444
98,"@AmericanAir 1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and..."

100,@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?
101,@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I'm getting different reports?
102,@AmericanAir ...2/2 doesn't help me.
103,"@AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!"
104,"@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU"
105,@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt
106,"@AmericanAir offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you're supposed to provide"
107,@AmericanAir its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
108,@AmericanAir 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8
109,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
110,@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
111,@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
112,"@AmericanAir now I have to wait ""more than 60 minutes"""
113,@AmericanAir overbooked business class from Mia to uvf - after being in the correct seat we were moved back to economy on our special day
114,@AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
115,"@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week."

127,@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
128,@AmericanAir between your airline and @united I've now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars...
129,@AmericanAir what an incredibly arrogant thing to say while I sit here at O'Hare waiting for your incompetent airlines to refuel on a...
130,@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.
131,@AmericanAir there is two hour wait
132,@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
133,@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
134,@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
135,@AmericanAir - cruel &amp; unusual to Cancelled Flight flight w/o notice &amp; make someone stay on hold for 30min &amp; listen to the same ad in a loop
136,@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...
137,@AmericanAir 953 our  fligth Somthing to talk  about this?
138,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
139,@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
140,@AmericanAir can I get home before 12 or no?
141,"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company."

152,@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
153,@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
154,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
155,"@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!"
156,@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.

162,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
163,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
164,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."

186,@AmericanAir right on cue with the delaysðŸ‘Œ
187,@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
188,@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
189,@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
190,@AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
191,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
192,@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
193,@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
194,@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
195,@AmericanAir Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?
196,@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
197,@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
198,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
199,@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
200,@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
201,@AmericanAir im still on hold...
202,@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
203,@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
204,@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
205,"@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?"
206,@AmericanAir why did you drop my call. Why don't you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call
207,@AmericanAir I can't work with them if the call gets cut off while I'm still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow?
208,@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you
209,@AmericanAir why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn't been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this?
210,"@AmericanAir I have got a flight for
The next day !! What about a credit ! You guys are a multimillion dollar company give us back a Credit"
211,@AmericanAir dont send me a tweet to cover your social media complaints. How about sending me a message with a way to resolve?!?! #CustServ
212,"@AmericanAir @barrettkarabis what a joke you can mail
The receipt !! Yet. We can't mail
Them
A payment and fly before hand right"
213,@AmericanAir btr trained gate agts. Im a frequent flyer &amp; have nvr had issue w/my bag 2day I was forced 2 gate check while priority boarding
214,@AmericanAir any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight?
215,"@AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow, can't get thru on phone, long wait then cut off x2, can you help please?"
216,"@AmericanAir I waited on hold for two hours, only to have my call. Really unreliable."
217,"@AmericanAir Hey, AA! There was a mistake made by your CR on my Flight Booking Problems. When I call your reservations #, I keep getting hung up on. Advise."
218,@AmericanAir emailed AAdvantage for status match ... still waiting.  Can't wait to move from @united but help me out here :)
219,@AmericanAir I bought a plane ticket 2 months ago and still haven't received my flight info and ticket in my email when it will come?
220,@AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
221,"@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes"
222,@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
223,@AmericanAir I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I'm suree you guys don't care
224,@AmericanAir I have a ticket that has been pending for 4 days. Is it normal to take that long?? I want to make sure there isn't a problem.
225,@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble
226,@AmericanAir for my delay and you know what I get a we don't credit anybody back a supervisor who cut me off when speaking
227,@AmericanAir yes I did but no response.
228,@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
229,@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
230,@AmericanAir Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice
231,"@AmericanAir I fly American because of family but severe weather excuse so I can't call to make change, why have a computer if u cant modify"
232,"@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because ""severe weather"" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each."
233,@AmericanAir just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately.
234,"@AmericanAir already spoke to that line, unwilling to help - really poor support #hitawall"
235,@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
236,@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
237,@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!
238,@AmericanAir probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it!
239,@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
240,@AmericanAir been calling all morning. Still can't get through. I need to chge a flight that is this week!!!!!
241,@AmericanAir should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... http://t.co/4SFpcbyy9m
242,"@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh.."
243,@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
244,@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
245,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
246,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
247,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
248,"@AmericanAir I've been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up?"
249,@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
250,@AmericanAir im tryin to book a flight but cant get ahold of anyone!
251,@AmericanAir already shared with them. Nothing done!
252,"@AmericanAir I really can't there though to an agent, and I am worried about my reservation. Can you help me out!"
253,@AmericanAir Hi. Get error msg when trying to check in on line. States: wrong pass#. Tickets rcvd from AA due to training in DFW. U know Y?
254,"@AmericanAir I paid using Paypal online and after I was charged there was a ""System Error"" which is what I ended up calling about."
255,"@AmericanAir that's why I'm asking for exception. Staffer moving last minute,we're a nonprofit &amp; losing $400,we just want to change ticket."
256,@AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I've been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent!
257,@AmericanAir yes there's issues on the site as well unfortunately.
258,"@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?"
259,"@americanair the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call.  If you don't answer, #hardtodo"
260,"@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant"
261,@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
262,@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.
263,"@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!"
264,"@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim"
265,@AmericanAir been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10...  Any advice?
266,"@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?"
267,"@AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r"
268,@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
269,@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
270,@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
271,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
272,"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
273,"@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!"
274,@AmericanAir is there a way to reserve my dogâ€™s flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline!
275,"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
276,"@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
277,@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry
278,@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
279,@AmericanAir not helpful
280,"@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt"
281,"@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold"
282,@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
283,@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.
284,@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
285,@AmericanAir Still on hold. Way to suck.
286,@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung upâ€¦
287,@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
288,@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
289,@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!
290,@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
291,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"
292,@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
293,@AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true
294,"@AmericanAir There was no one from #AA at the #woase2015 event @HelsinkiAirport
Lots of info available of #winterops"
295,@AmericanAir been calling for over 24hrs now and getting no where but told to call back by the automated system is extremely frustrating
296,@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
297,@AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?
298,@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
299,"@AmericanAir Define ""sincerely"". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media."
300,@AmericanAir you said this last time. It doesn't take 6 weeks to reply to an email.
301,@AmericanAir I'm trying to make a reservation with a &lt; 2 year old lap child. Don't see any option online. How do I proceed with reservation?
302,"@AmericanAir - I'd be happy to hold on the phone, but your phone system is not allowing that and simply hangs up."
303,"@AmericanAir Thanks but don't understand why they couldn't have used the tug at the next gate over, ground crew took a break? #unacceptable"
304,@AmericanAir That will be the third time I have been called by 800-433-7300 an hung on before anyone speaks. What do I do now???
305,@AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min
306,@AmericanAir 2 months and still no exec platinum member cards. What gives?
307,"@AmericanAir For the love of all that is holy, if your automated phone system is going to give like 8 options, give numerical shortcuts"
308,@AmericanAir @British_Airways trying to speak with an agent about my flight to London tonight but can't get anyone from AA.  Can you help?
309,@AmericanAir I've been trying to reach your customer service for TWO days. I have received zero response. Never traveling AA again.
310,@AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help
311,@AmericanAir I need to rebook and I cannot get an agent. Can you help?
312,@AmericanAir back in UK now no thanks to your staff that wouldn't me or the other passengers stranded. Just laughed at us
313,"@AmericanAir Well if you won't let me handle my reservation/change online, &amp; your Reservation call # hangs up on me wtf do I do?? Bullshit."
314,@AmericanAir received an email requesting I call about a res. but I keep getting kicked off of your phone system. Help?
315,@AmericanAir you have said the same thing to me over and over again but phrased differently. How about some actual help?
316,@AmericanAir I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
317,"@AmericanAir You didn't call, did you. Try it, and then you'll understand.  It's not possible to reach an agent,I don't know what else to do"
318,"@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :("
319,@AmericanAir How am I supposed to Cancelled Flight it if I can't do it online?  I don't want to lose all the funds on the ticket.  HELP!!! :(
320,@AmericanAir I need HELP!  I'm trying to Cancelled Flight a flight before it takes off but I can't get a hold of ANYONE because all lines are busy.
321,@AmericanAir No I was not given the choice by the rep Meelan (UK AA Contact Center) to escaLate Flight to a supervisor and had to book with change
322,@AmericanAir I can't get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got.
323,@AmericanAir She could even see that I had tried to make the transaction but wouldn't offer me the price I'd tried to purchase it at.
324,"@AmericanAir @USAirways ""ma'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk"" {sees line ~45 people deep}"
325,"@AmericanAir So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff"
326,@AmericanAir I DM'd you. Anything you can do?
327,@AmericanAir this is all i gotta say to y'all &amp; your staff... for real http://t.co/rKPRxTGvfL
328,"@AmericanAir No, it wouldn't let me complete transaction because it was one way from Barbados to NYC"
329,@AmericanAir I'm still patiently waiting for a response to my complaint email on Fri. What is the normal response time?
330,@AmericanAir the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
331,"@AmericanAir SJC-&gt;LAX. After the fourth time, I gave up!"
332,@AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
333,@AmericanAir Can you add my KTN to an existing reservation? It's not letting me add it online....
334,@AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys!
335,@AmericanAir don't see response!
336,"@AmericanAir @united contact me, or do something to alleviate this terrible, terrible service. But no, your 22 year old social media guru"
337,"@AmericanAir @united week is going to make up for anything, or put me at ease.  You should be asking me how you can fix things, how to..."
338,"@AmericanAir @united and a complete lack of faith in your companies. It's really a shame that you think telling me ""it's been a challenging"""
339,@AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
340,@AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
341,@AmericanAir I tried already and I am on the waiting list for a call back #2hourwaitsucks
342,"@AmericanAir 4 phone calls, 2 hrs of being sent back &amp; forth between two lines in the terminal and it's the skycap that finds a solution"
343,@AmericanAir No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven't gotten one yet.
344,@AmericanAir Please try it yourself - call 1-800-433-7300 and see what happens... then you'll understand.  #allrepresentativesbusy #nooption
345,"@AmericanAir I tried to check in, but they redirect me to call in to @USAirways, which I also can't get into contact with"
346,"@AmericanAir --(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can't."
347,@AmericanAir yes but not with much help from you guys
348,"@AmericanAir Are there any travel advisories for Toronto, ON today? I can't access anything regarding international travel on your website--"
349,"@AmericanAir I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven't heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information!"
350,"@AmericanAir My reservation is on hold, not me.  Wish I was on hold but that's not possible with the phone issues at #americanair"
351,@AmericanAir You are having phone issues.  Please fix it!!!!
352,"@AmericanAir I can't!!!  No one can't get to ""hold"".  You can't get past the automated reply.  It hangs up on you.  #FRUSTRATED"
353,@AmericanAir - answer the phones.  Trying to change a reservation and haven't been able to get a human to pick up in two days.
354,"@AmericanAir now because you couldn't add my ktn, which I asked for numerous times and no one answers the phone, I missed my flight!!#upset"
355,@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
356,@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?
357,@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N

360,@AmericanAir I did set up notifications through AA &amp; Us airways. still nothing
361,@AmericanAir how can I get travel question answered quickly... Online and calling not helping with this busy day
362,"@AmericanAir The website won't let me view my reservation due to ""changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY"". I'm on hold now to get help."
363,@AmericanAir it's not a friend it's a legally required chaperone on a school trip.
364,"@AmericanAir it's more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone 
Res. on hold and can't get thru to use a credit to pay for it"
365,@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
366,@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
367,@AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me
368,@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
369,"@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?"
370,@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
371,@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
372,@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
373,@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
374,@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
375,@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
376,"@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice"
377,@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
378,@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
379,"@AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.
Direct email?"
380,"@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says ""try again Late Flightr, goodbye""."
381,@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!

385,"@AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven't heard anything yet."
386,@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
387,@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
388,@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
389,"@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked."
390,.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
391,"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."
392,@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.

397,"@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?"
398,@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back
399,"@AmericanAir If you care, could you have someone call me to explain what is going on."

401,@AmericanAir me up in a hotel tonight and expect me to now pay even more money. I don't have that money!! I was supposed to get a call back
402,@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
403,@AmericanAir stranded in Miami because your automated system keeps hanging up on me for two days. Help !
404,@AmericanAir trying to get thru to agent since last night b/c AA changed our flight to 2 days from now. Infuriating! We need to get to SEA!

406,@AmericanAir I am still waiting for that call back. Stranded and no one to talk to
407,.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
408,@AmericanAir. All I get is an automated system that hangs up on me. I finally get a message that some will call me back in 2 hours.
409,@AmericanAir @emrey35 But it says your agents are too busy and to try back Late Flightr???
410,"@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?"
411,"@AmericanAir how about a reservation phone system that actually works? You know the 800 number is unreachable? Callbacks are ""dead air""."
412,@AmericanAir no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated
413,@AmericanAir thank you Mr Parker for screwing over chairman preferred when we fly AA. No #firstclass option and treated like crap by staff

420,"@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help."
421,"@AmericanAir @loganex except if you call now you'll get the same message. Trust me, I've tried."
422,@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me ðŸ˜­
423,@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
424,@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
425,@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
426,"@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call"
427,"@AmericanAir How best to talk with an agent to reschedule Cancelled Flighted flight? No one answers at AA. Know it's busy, but need help.Thanks"
428,@AmericanAir speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
429,@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.

439,@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
440,@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
441,"@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2"
442,@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
443,"@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?"

452,"@AmericanAir  I was told it would be emailed to me, but I haven't received anything yet. How can I follow-up?"
453,"@AmericanAir that's interesting-Agent told me so. Sadly, another booked passenger didn't make it to gate by push back so I made it on."
454,@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #DFW due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....
455,@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
456,"@AmericanAir Need to change flight, but the CS # is telling me it can't take my call. Can't change online. Please help. Flight is this week."
457,"@AmericanAir No, when I call AA now I can't even get on hold...can you help me?"
458,"@AmericanAir I have ""continued contacting"" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid."
459,@AmericanAir DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic
460,"@AmericanAir Thank you for holding, we apologize for the delay in answering your call. To speak to a representative please continue to hold."
461,"@AmericanAir @dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd..."
462,@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
463,@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
464,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
465,"@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful."
466,@AmericanAir cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all I got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
467,@AmericanAir but at least your automated message gives me info about your merger w/ @USAirways. Another airline I know to avoid.
468,@AmericanAir wht n ðŸ‘Ž experience w/aa reservations #service Tried to be patient with rep and she just disconnects me aa do u record conv.?
469,"@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful."
470,"@AmericanAir Nope, I have not been rebooked."
471,@AmericanAir - I am Platinum.  I am flying USAir and they have stranded me in CLT.  Not answering phones. Did not rebook me.  Please help?
472,@AmericanAir is AA951 to SÃ£o Paulo taking off today? Your colleagues won't tell us any thing
473,"@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?"
474,"@AmericanAir Yes, but should be able to get a push notification via the app if Iâ€™m logged in and on a trip. Email/text is so 2010 ðŸ˜¥."
475,@AmericanAir How do I check? Reservation for Joe Watson and Kelsey Jennings. We were on hold for 2 hours. Waiting for call back now. ETA?
476,@AmericanAir on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.
477,@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable
478,@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
479,"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
480,@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
481,"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic"
482,@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
483,@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
484,@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
485,"@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online."
486,@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
487,@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
488,@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
489,@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
490,@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
491,@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
492,@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
493,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
494,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
495,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
496,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
497,@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
498,@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
499,@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
500,@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
501,@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
502,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
503,@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
504,@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
505,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
506,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
507,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
508,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
509,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
510,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
511,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful ðŸ˜³"
512,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
513,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
514,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
515,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
516,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
517,"@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#"
518,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
519,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
520,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
521,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
522,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
523,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
524,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
525,@AmericanAir Iâ€™ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
526,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
527,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
528,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
529,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
530,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
531,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
532,"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO"
533,"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
534,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
535,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
536,@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
537,@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
538,@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
539,"@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?"
540,@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
541,@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
542,@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
543,@AmericanAir - don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
544,@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
545,@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
546,"@AmericanAir Got an email about an itinerary change, but can't seem to get to anyone on phone. New flight time doesn't work for me. Help?"
547,"@AmericanAir @sa_craig no, not helped one bit. actually ended up driving home due to extreme disorganization and lack of communication."
548,@AmericanAir United needs our ticket number since you rebooked us and you gave the incorrect ticket number now we can't check in #help
549,#nothelpful MT @AmericanAir: Our call volume is extremely high today. Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance.
550,@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?
551,@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
552,@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
553,@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
554,@AmericanAir sitting in a 2 hour long at least phone queue. Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears
555,"@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up."
556,@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
557,@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff
558,@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
559,"@AmericanAir Orbitz has only shown ""priority"" seats since we booked &amp; paid 3 weeks ago."
560,"@AmericanAir Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP!"
561,@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
562,"@AmericanAir Where are your ticket offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use voucher on website, what a headache! PLEASE HELP!"
563,@AmericanAir I need to change a ticket and my res can't be changed online.  I also can't get a call through due to high volume--can u help?
564,@AmericanAir Reservation Line won't let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?
565,@AmericanAir Im trying to call and book a reward ticket on one world partners but your automated system wont let me talk to any1.  Great job
566,@AmericanAir @travisamex please please American call me so I can rebook ticket .
567,"@AmericanAir  Dear American, when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard?  Have you heard of additional staffing during weather?"
568,"@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves."
569,@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
570,@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal
571,"@AmericanAir need assistance. very frustrated I can't reach reservations by phone. trying to book online &amp; get ""fare no longer avail"" msg"
572,@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
573,"@AmericanAir flight 2470 tomorrow, have no idea if we've been rescheduled and can't fix online? Have to talk to an agent yet no one answers?"
574,@AmericanAir Are you kidding? You don't think I've done that?? I've called dozens of times &amp; it tells me to call back &amp; hangs up.
575,@AmericanAir I did. Should i expect a response in this fiscal year? This calendar year? Never?
576,@AmericanAir is there not an email address I can send my issue to? you guys screwed up and rebooked my flight to the wrong day!  please help
577,@AmericanAir  please call us back to rebook!!! 7403607771. We need to get back to Columbus!!!!!! Please help
578,"@AmericanAir...still waiting for a call back....attempt #9 and hour #13...can't put a hold on an online tix, we are within seven day window."
579,@AmericanAir - gold elite loyalty customer..can't count on my hometown preferred airline to do right. #bummed..
580,@AmericanAir @tcunningham10 please call us back to rebook. 7403607771 we can't through!!!!! We need to get to columbus!!!!
581,@AmericanAir  flight to dca I need to change asap help can't get through
582,@AmericanAir I need to order a special meal and I can't reach AA. Been on hold for over 2 hours
583,"@AmericanAir 245. I'm about to take off but one of your reps at a different gate was rude when I asked for assistance. Thanks, though."
584,"@AmericanAir really American Airlines , service is Las Vegas is shocking, absolute jokers take your reputation more seriously!"
585,@AmericanAir the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
586,@AmericanAir we got to 15 minutes AFTER takeoff time before anyone wandered over to address the line of people.
587,@AmericanAir there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
588,"@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!"
589,"@AmericanAir how did my prime, ticketed seat get switched on AA 343?! Not sure what's going on here..."
590,@AmericanAir cannot talk to any agents keep getting hung up on crazy
591,@AmericanAir On hold for 20 mins and then used the call back service only to have an agent call me and put me on hold forever-anyone there?
592,@AmericanAir thnkx bt dont help now we will need to go WAY out of OUR way to get where we NEED to be for the $ u charge this sux #neveragain
593,@AmericanAir Somehow between DFW and MIA I got bumped from 12B all the way to 41G on 2312? What's up with that?
594,"@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines 1 1/2 hr wait for bags. If this is the a taste of the worlds largest airline, heaven help aviation"
595,@AmericanAir Can't get thru by phone to use a credit that's about to expire! #frustrated #aa.com
596,@AmericanAir now down to only one agent helping a stagnant line of almost 100 customers. Super.
597,".@AmericanAir Also, not the reservations team's fault. Bad top-down decision. I feel bad for the reservations AND social media teams."
598,@AmericanAir @TheNateK I submitted a complaint via that link in Dec. &amp; followed up in Jan. NEVER HEARD BACK! #badcustomerservice
599,@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
600,"@AmericanAir @naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?"
601,"@AmericanAir i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am"
602,@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
603,@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
604,"@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your ""team"" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting."
605,@AmericanAir cut it. Put me on a flt tomorrow.
606,@AmericanAir can you help me with a reservation? cant get through on the phone
607,@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
608,@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
609,@AmericanAir Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear.
610,.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
611,"@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though."
612,@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
613,@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
614,"@AmericanAir @brewcrewfan8 Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life? You should be emailing/calling/DMing people you've inconvenienced."
615,@AmericanAir hey there me again from yesterday im still on hold
616,@AmericanAir What's the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful.
617,@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
618,@AmericanAir don't you guys have an email address? Just put me on the next available flight from ohare
619,"@AmericanAir your call center won't let me wait on hold, which I would happily do. Am I seriously supposed to just keep calling? Not great"
620,"@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that"
621,@AmericanAir I've been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone.
622,"@AmericanAir  beyond frustrated with no call back from auto hold or whatever you call it. Entered my number at 11:30 CST, still no call 2:26"
623,@AmericanAir ahhhh your silence is golden now.  This tops it all.  Anyone get fired?
624,@AmericanAir Hey AA - can you help with an itinerary for a plat custy?  Stuck in PVR and phones aren't working
625,@AmericanAir we've been on hold for hours.
626,"@AmericanAir &amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason"
627,"@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards"
628,@AmericanAir I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?
