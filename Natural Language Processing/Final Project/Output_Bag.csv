0,@usairways Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway‚Äîwhy not just put thru baggage claim?
1,@USAirways I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia!
2,@USAirways no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify
3,@USAirways you have the ability to switch my flight to @AmericanAir but you cannot tell me where my bags are.
4,"Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways"
5,@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
6,@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
7,@AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska üòí
8,@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM
9,@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
10,@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
11,"@AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX"
12,"@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead."
13,"@AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling."
14,"@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to""arrange pick up""in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!"
15,@AmericanAir I'll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru @dfwairport. I ‚ù§Ô∏è these earrings!!
16,"@AmericanAir checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas.  Baggage was only checked to ORD."
17,@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
18,@AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
19,@AmericanAir - you broke my sick wife's luggage handle going from JFK to LAX...she had to drag her bag thru the airport! #customerservice
20,"@AmericanAir My bag flew with AA while I flew with Delta, and I'm still not sure whose final carrier is referred to."
21,@AmericanAir you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse
22,@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
23,@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
24,@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
25,@AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.
26,@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
27,"@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!"
28,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
29,@AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?!
30,"@AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where'smybag"
31,@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
32,"@AmericanAir ""bag has not yet been located"". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?"
33,"@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability"
34,@AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
35,"@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology"
36,@AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer
37,@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
38,@AmericanAir Pathetic answer. Just found out my bag has been sitting at LGA for 20 hours and no call from you to lmk or delivery of bag. BAD
39,@AmericanAir spent hour+ trying to check after to use military ID for luggage then messed up boarding pass &amp; forced into line again.
40,@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
41,@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
42,@AmericanAir been calling 2 different offices already and still no sign of my baggage. First time on American Air.. (6)
43,"@AmericanAir my two coats were in that bag so i have been in france with no coat, walking around with a T shirt and one clean pair.(3)"
44,@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
45,"@AmericanAir So i was visiting SJU and was returning to Paris and they checked my bag at the gate in SJU, i arrived in paris and nothing,(1)"
46,@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
47,@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset
48,"@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website"
49,@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
50,@AmericanAir thx for losing my bag. How hard is it to care for a bag w PRIORITY on it?why do u cont to not care for EP's?
51,@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscarüòÑüíùüíùüíù
52,@AmericanAir what are the odds my bag was picked up by someone not me while in another country? Because it says it hasn't been located yet.
53,@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
54,@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
55,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
56,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
57,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
58,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
59,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
60,@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(
61,@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
62,@AmericanAir arrived in lax from ord flight AA1657 NO LUGGAGE
63,"@AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would ""eventually get her bag"" completely unacceptable"
64,@AmericanAir After 3 days NO BAGs amazing the way that you neglect customers
65,@AmericanAir they did tell that our luggage stayed inside the plane ! Look this video http://t.co/YokkHHQcMP
66,@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD
67,@AmericanAir an hour at baggage carousel and still no luggage?? Nail in the coffin.
68,@AmericanAir since we are leaving tomorrow to miami can you do one thing right and deliver the bags to the airport?
69,@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.
70,@USAirways And it's 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update?
71,@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
72,@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
73,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
74,"@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading."
75,@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!
76,.@USAirways we r rebooked. got conflicting info abt baggage. Y no extra plane batteries on hand? Y no comped admirals club for 9 hr wait?
77,@USAirways No I missed the funeral so I had to take a train back to Newark
78,"@USAirways Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral."
79,@USAirways and it still says it's on time on your website btw
80,"@USAirways we are on the 2pm flight FLL to PHL and then connection to MAN. However, with the delays we might miss it. Can we go earlier?"
81,@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
82,@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed

84,@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
85,"@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest."
86,@AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire
87,@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
88,@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
89,"@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber."
90,@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
91,"@AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for ""rampers"" #AA4285"
92,@AmericanAir there is a fat man stuck in your airplanes bathroom
93,@AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
94,@AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx
95,@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
96,"@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. ""We will take off soon."" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW."
97,@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
98,@AmericanAir how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci
99,"@AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love!"
100,@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
101,"@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll"
102,@AmericanAir fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space.
103,".@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue."
104,".@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded..."
105,"@AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow"
106,@AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty
107,@AmericanAir what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable
108,@AmericanAir I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
109,"@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen."
110,"@AmericanAir ""sorry you were disappointed"" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs"
111,@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
112,@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
113,@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
114,"@AmericanAir Just took off. Sitting with someone who is scheduled on Buenos ares out of JFK,not sre if he will make it. R thy holding plane?"
115,@AmericanAir improve Envoy's performance.  5th trip through ORD in 2015 I've been delayed for hours because of Envoy.  I could drive faster!
116,@AmericanAir two Cancelled Flightled LGA flights. Both by @Delta took off. Looks like I have a new carrier @Delta!
117,@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open. Hope I don't miss my connection.... #logistics #AmericanView
118,@AmericanAir not having pillows or blankets or a flight home for 40 people does bad things to my hair
119,"@AmericanAir after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That's BS too.."
120,"@AmericanAir AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized"
121,@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
122,"@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said ""we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch""!"
123,"@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour."
124,@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
125,@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
126,@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
127,@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
128,@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service.
129,@AmericanAir 6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink
130,@AmericanAir because your plane's toilet wasn't working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some...
131,@AmericanAir boarded flight 2334 at 8:30am.  Now 11:40.  Still sitting on runway.  Lots o fun
132,@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag
133,"@AmericanAir confused at the definition of a ""preferred seat."" I paid extra for one and got a regular seat with no legroom. Unimpressed."
134,@AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn't address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane
135,"@AmericanAir flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me..."

142,"@AmericanAir file loc:TJYCQH. Bag at airport since last nite.Not ""scheduled"" to get PU unt aft 8? WHY? U shld b ashamed. I'm disgusted w/u"
143,@AmericanAir not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside

149,"@AmericanAir I paid extra $ for my seat &amp; the monitor didn't work from on AA111. How about a refund on the seat? Conf #: MDBEEI, McMullen"
150,"@AmericanAir Hey AA, a suggestion: Note on your seat maps what seats have electronics box blocking legroom. AA215 http://t.co/hcNN0wXQQr"
151,@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
152,@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
153,@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
154,@AmericanAir no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay

156,@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
157,@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
158,@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days

166,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
167,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
168,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
169,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
170,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"

207,@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.
208,@AmericanAir .....and they waited 5 hours in a stuffy plane until they could get off then 7 more hrs to get their luggage  #AmericanAirlines
209,@AmericanAir 3078 is overweight so you pull 2 dozen passengers off? Why not luggage? Seriously?

213,@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
214,"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
215,".@AmericanAir No. I watched these bags be abandoned at depart gate. Watched for &gt;40 mins until owner returned, 20+ mins after I reported"
216,@AmericanAir I tried site &amp; doesnt allow me. Same reason why I wasn't allowed to board this morning. Will try diff airline for work trips

225,@AmericanAir What's with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes.
226,"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
227,@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
228,@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
229,@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
230,"@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit."
231,"@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again."
232,@AmericanAir you're not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn't get us home - and we're at ORD
233,@AmericanAir poor customer service is just unacceptable.. Also how bout the surfer on the front of your website. #noloveforsurfers #pretend
234,@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
235,@AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
236,@AmericanAir your staff at JFK airport are discussing the way we we're left stranded
237,@AmericanAir the app doesn't allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger.
238,@AmericanAir is your website down? I haven't been able to check in to my flight all morning.
239,"@AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: ""can I have some water?"" ""no we don't do that. please take your seat"""
240,@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
241,@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
242,@AmericanAir you have the worst reps at Jacksonville airport. So rude and totally not helpful at all!
243,"@AmericanAir I'm trying to register since 12:00,don't want to be separated from my brother during the15hours flight!There're few places left"
244,@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
245,@AmericanAir 20 HS students from Ithaca NY stuck in Miami flts xld u won't rebook to get kids home use carrier alliance #rulesshouldbend
246,@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
247,"@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your ""customer service"" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS"
248,@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
249,@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
250,@AmericanAir @USAirways and the way I have been spoken to by #DFW and #Mia employees is truly disgusting. Save the pain fly with anyone else
251,‚Äú@AmericanAir Thanks for info on super large passengers- the extra seat Mr. Big needed was the one i was sitting in already #customerservice
252,@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
253,@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
254,@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
255,"@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer"
256,@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
257,@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
258,@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
259,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
260,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
261,@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
262,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
263,@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
264,@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
265,@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
266,"@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him ""I understand English."" His reply?""Our conversation is over."""
267,@AmericanAir ‚Ä¶ Been trying to book a whole new flight since 2 hours!! what is wrong with your website?
268,@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF
269,"@AmericanAir 's computer systems are down, can't leave without a flight plan! Any ETA, American air?"
270,@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
271,"@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An ""aw, let me help"" cld mk it btr"
272,@AmericanAir you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir.
273,@AmericanAir I have been on hold 3 hours.  2 seconds of it with a rude agent.
274,@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
275,"@AmericanAir That's a complete cop out! U ask what the issues are, then do nothing about it. How are we supposed to sort the situation now?"
276,@AmericanAir fcuk you. Shit service. You got no fans.
277,@americanair Seattle check-in. 1 desk servicing full service line. 2 desks servicing priority. Full srvc wait 30+ minutes. Customer svc fail
278,@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
279,@AmericanAir my flt is at 7a tom. I have now rec'd notification that I'm going out from some other airport
280,"@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever."
281,@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
282,@AmericanAir please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks.
283,@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.
284,"@AmericanAir i was also told by agents my issues ""aren't their prob"" K fine. I get it. But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!!"
285,@AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
286,"@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome."
287,".@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same."
288,@AmericanAir I‚Äôll play it by ear. I know that you are doing your best. Buy some chewey oatmeal cookies for your customer care folks.
289,@AmericanAir @ShannonBloom Where's my DM? Where's my voucher? Who's paying my $70 cab and my $50 car back to JFK tomorrow?
